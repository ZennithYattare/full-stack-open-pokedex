## About This Project

This project is part of the **Full Stack Open** course, focusing on **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**. The objective is to automate the development workflow by setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. This ensures efficient code testing, automated builds, and seamless deployments.

Unlike other projects in the course, this module emphasizes configuration rather than extensive coding. The primary goal is to understand, set up, and optimize CI/CD pipelines.

## CI/CD Pipelines

This project includes a CI/CD pipeline configured using **GitHub Actions**, which performs the following tasks:

- Linting the code  
- Running unit tests  
- Building the application  
- Running end-to-end tests  
- Deploying the application  

The workflow file can be found at `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`.

### Deployment  

The application is deployed and can be accessed here:
